# Election Analysis
**Performing Audit on Election Data**

  ## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this project is to develop a python script to carry out a congressional election audit. When the script is run, the following will be calculated, displayed in Terminal and also writen and saved to an output text file:
  + Total Number of votes cast
  + Complete list of counties and their corresponding votes
  + Complete list of candidates and the total number of votes each candidate received
  + Percentage of votes each candidates and county received
  + County with the largest turnout
  + The winner of the election based on popular votes

   - County Votes
     + **Jefferson : 10.5% (38,855)**
     + **Denver: 82.8% (306,055)**
     + **Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)**
   
   - Largest County Turnout
     + **Denver**

   - Candidate Votes
     + **Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)**
     + **Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)**
     + **Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)**

     + **Winning Vote Count: 272,892**
     + **Winning Percentage: 73.8%**


  ## Election-Audit Summary
 
  This script can be modified to be adaptive for use in any election by providing the follwing modifications:
  
  - The script can be modified to take input data and generate any user's customised database that will be uploaded into python for analysis. In this way, we will be able to make provisions for as many candidates and counties as possible for any possible geographical location.
  
  -  Furthermore, the script can be modified to accomodate more demographics like age and gender. This will enable statistical analysis and planning to be carried out using the demographics gotten from the election result.
